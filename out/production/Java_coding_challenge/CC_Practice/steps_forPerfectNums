//1. declare a variable limit, assign it to 10000
//2. create boolean method which takes int as an argument give name "num"
//3. declare variable temp, assign it to 0;
//4. create for loop (starting from 1; less or equal to num; iteration)
//5. continue for loop with if delimiter == 0 temp += i
//6. compare temp and num, return true if it equal
//7. else > false
//8. create void method
//9. start timing
//10.iterate started from 1 to limit add if statement
//taking result from above method taking arg f.e i from main method
//11. print i + " , "
//12. finish timing
//13. print timing result
